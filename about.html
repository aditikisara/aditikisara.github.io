                <h4> Hi, I'm Aditi!</h4>
                <p>
                    I love the process of design to development. Whether is sketching wireframes or optimizing code for performance, 
                    I relish every step of the creative process.  My journey in web development has been marked a committment to stay 
                    up-to-date with the latest design trends and coding techniques, ensuring that I deliver a product that is not 
                    only aesthetic, but functional.

                    I majored in Computer Science and Engineering in my undergrad, and I learned so much from the projects I've 
                    worked on throughout my time there. From developing algorithms and data structures to building scalable software 
                    solutions to real companies, my wide range of coursework and projects has provided me with a solid foundation in 
                    computer science.

                    A year later, I completed my masters in Human-Computer Interaction and Design, where I learned the fundamentals 
                    of user-centric design. While my undergrad projects were focused on functionality, my masters degree was emphasized 
                    on empathy around user-centered thinking in the design process. Through this program, I've gained the skills to 
                    conduct proper user research, and use tools like journey mapping and personas to create prototypes that cater to the 
                    specific needs and preferences of end-users. 
    
                    <br><br>
    
                    With my combined knowledge of UX and computer science, I'm excited to continue my career journey by working on 
                    projects that prioritize user satisfaction, accessibility, and innovation.
