            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                Code.org is an educational, nonprofit organization that strives to make computer science education accessible to students all 
                over the world, with a focus on diverse and underrepresented populations. Code.org wants to make CS education as accessible as 
                possible, and with the majority of the world's population owning 4G phones, there's an opportunity to expand exposure to CS 
                curriculum in lower-income regions and diverse populations through these mobile devices. The goal of our work with Code.org is 
                to design a mobile version of their Computer Science Fundamentals (CSF) Express curriculum for kids from 2nd to 8th grade in 
                the global South. We expect our prototype to be customizable, exploratory, rewarding, and user friendly to meet our young users' 
                needs. In the long term, we hope our project will be able to help kids in the global South develop their programming skills by 
                using the mobile version of Code.org's CSF Express curriculum.

                <br><br>

                Feel free to play with our mobile prototype! If you're using a phone, make sure it's in horizontal mode. (Note that because the 
                app is designed for a large Android screen, it may not perfectly fit your phone. That's alright! You can still play through it 
                just fine). If you're on a laptop or desktop computer, use your mouse or trackpad to navigate through the app. 

                <br><br>    

                Note: Any mention of “client” in this page refers to Code.org.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>The Plan</h5>
            <p>
                We had a tight 6-month timeframe in order to get this project done. As the Project Manager (PM), I utilized waterfall timelines 
                to create a plan that outlined when each part of the project should be completed to ensure that our team of five completed the 
                project on time.
                
                <br><br>
                
                These were the main stages of our research:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <b>Initial Research.</b> This consisted of a competitive analysis and a literature review surrounding the scope of our project. 
                        We also conducted a cognitive walkthrough of our client's CSF Express curriculum.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Phase 1 Research.</b> This is when we conducted our first round of in-person/remote qualitative user interviews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Phase 1 Design.</b> Based on the findings from our Phase 1 research and client feedback, we designed an initial prototype of 
                        the mobile application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Phase 2.1 Research.</b> We tested our initial prototype with end users through in-person qualitative interviews.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Phase 2.1 Design.</b> Adjusted the prototype based on findings from Phase 2.1 research and client feedback.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Phase 2.2 Research.</b> A smaller scale of Phase 2.1 research, with the goal of refining the prototype and focusing on the 
                        big picture.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>Phase 2.2 Design.</b> Refined prototype based on findings from Phase 2.2 research and client feedback.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                Here's our general timeline for the duration of the project. 
            </p>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/code_org/timeline.png"/>
            
            <br>
            <h5>Tools Used</h5>
            <br>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/code_org/tools_used.png"/>
            <br>
            <p>
                We used Dovetail to transcribe and code our user interviews, FigJam to create our affinity map and synthesize our data, and Figma to create 
                our prototype.

            <h5>Initial Research</h5>
            <h6>Competitive Analysis</h6>
            <p>
                We looked at seven different online learning platforms, each dedicated to teaching students a defined curriculum. In particular, we looked 
                at how competitors kept their users engaged through gamification within their mobile application and how they designed their mobile 
                interfaces to effectively deliver their curriculum.

                <br><br>

                We utilized Nielsen's Heuristics, Wharton's Cognitive Walkthroughs, Krug's usability principles, and Jill Butler's Universal Principles of 
                Design to inform the design of an intuitive and feedback-rich mobile coding interface, ensuring an optimal user experience.

                        Microsoft MakeCode is a free online learn-to-code platform where anyone can build games, code devices, and mod Minecraft. They 
                        offer block-based coding for beginners and text-based coding for intermediate and advanced learners. Users go through 
                        step-by-step tutorials to complete projects and learn computer science concepts.

                        MakeCode is targeted to middle schoolers, which is the same target demographic as Code.org. They offer coding opportunities 
                        of all proficiency types, including block-based coding for beginners. They also teach students how to code by having them complete 
                        projects, similar to some of the projects on Code.org's website (not in the CSF curriculum).
                    </td>
                    <td>
                        All of MakeCode's projects are tutorial-based to teach students CS concepts. Code.org can do a similar thing within their CSF 
                        Express website to teach code using guided projects. They also have defined learning paths based on how users rate their own 
                        coding proficiency. Because Code.org's CSF curriculum is a free-roam experience, having a defined pathway can help to tailor the 
                        curriculum to the individual user.

                        Tickle is a block-based coding app on IOS devices that teaches young users how to code. They let users have full freedom to code 
                        whatever they want. They also have the option of coding external robots.

                        Tickle's target audience matches that of Code.org's. They both have the same goal of teaching code, and both use block-based 
                        coding to deliver this content. Additionally, both applications give users control in the curriculum to a certain extent. While 
                        Tickle gives users freedom to code whatever they like, Code.org let's users pick whatever activity they want to do within the CSF 
                        Express curriculum. Code.org also offers their end-of-course project, where users have the freedom to code anything they desire, 
                        just like with Tickle.

                        taught code to an older target audience, and their approach is through text-based coding like JavaScript. Their goal was to 
                        help users learn code to develop new skills, or shift to another career field. Unfortunately, Grasshopper shut down in June 2023.

            <h5>CSF Express Course - Cognititve Walkthrough</h5>
            <p>
                The main objective of the cognitive walkthrough was to understand the keyboard experience and how it could be implemented in an app 
                version. The ultimate goal is to migrate the client's web curriculum into a mobile application, while bringing over the same look and feel. 

                <br><br>

                Based on our initial research and this cognitive walkthrough, the following was kept in mind for the prototype:

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Keep the freedom of completing any activity (in a broader sense, keep the essence of the client's website the same)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Introduce gamification to motivate users to complete activities (addresses Guiding Question #1)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encourage user creativity through block-based coding (the current CSF Express course has an end-of-course project where users can 
                        code whatever they want. Incorporate something like this into the prototype)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Encourage users to explore different areas of CS concepts to reach a wider range of audiences (addresses Guiding Question #3)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Provide content in multiple formats to account for different learning styles (addresses Guiding Question #1)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Tailor the curriculum to address multiple coding backgrounds (addresses Guiding Question #2)
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </p>

            <h5>Phase 1 Research and Design</h5>
            
            <h6>Interviews</h6>
            <p>
                For today's kids to be successful in the future, our client believes that they will need to learn basic computer science concepts and 
                coding. The goal for this phase of research was to inform the initial design of our mobile prototype through qualitative user interviews.
                
                <br><br>

                We focused on learning:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Parents and children's beliefs and attitudes towards computer science in schools, and if they feel they will need to learn 
                        coding or computer science to be successful later in life
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        What gamification strategies and UI elements children respond positively to and why
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When children were provided access to mobile devices, and what limitations parents placed on those devices. Was this consistent 
                        between games and educational applications?
                    </li>
                </ul>

                We also conducted a cognitive walkthrough by having participants complete a lesson in the CSF Express curriculum. Through this, we 
                identified potential pain points that needed to be addressed within our prototype, gained insights into children's hobbies and 
                interests to learn what types of activities and topics they might be interested in learning about, and the intersection of computer 
                science with their hobby.

            <br><br>
            <h6>Synthesis</h6>
            <p>
                After conducting the interviews, we coded each transcript. This coding process involved categorizing participant's responses based on 
                overarching themes. Each team member coded multiple interviews outside of our own to ensure that we had a comprehensive analysis and 
                to avoid overlooking significant information. The team utilized Dovetail for coding transcripts and gathering insights.

                <br><br>

                Once all of our transcripts were coded, we imported the tagged quotes into FigJam and created our affinity map. Quotes were grouped 
                based on their tag. Through this, we were able to see patterns throughout the responses and generate our findings based on these 
                patterns.

                        Going from web to mobile, we wanted to keep the same hierarchy of lessons but changed the presentation. Here, we are in the topic of Sequencing 
                        and can see the four different lesson plans.

            <h5>Phase 2.1 Research and Design</h5>
            <h6>Interviews</h6>
            <p>
                The goal of this phase of research was to test our prototype and make significant changes based on client and user feedback 
                through qualitative user interviews. We closely observed user interactions with the application prototype. Participants 
                explored the designed app's features and UI elements, allowing us to deeply understand thoughts, preferences, usability, 
                strengths, and areas for improvement. Open-ended interviews gathered valuable qualitative data about impressions, likes, and 
                dislikes, guiding efforts to enhance user-friendliness.

                <br><br>

                Our main areas of focus:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Test out our primary navigation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        How the web translated to mobile; from AI for Oceans to new features like the playground. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If it was intuitive to all; ensure that the language was appropriate for kids in 2nd-8th graders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify UI elements and placement were appropriate for the screen positioning (e.g. vertical scrolling, light bulb icon, etc).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Directions and tutorial - how kids use them vs what we thought they would do.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Star system/gamification techniques - did it match what kids wanted and what they expected.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If it was an immersive experience where kids had full control. Would they rather be guided?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Verify the avatar and closet match what kids want/expect.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h6>Synthesis</h6>
            <p>
                We synthesized the findings to find the current strengths and weaknesses of our prototype. We focused on:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Whether the prototype was intuitive and where they got stuck
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Users' opinions about the home screen
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reward system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Exploration aspects (the Playground)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Connecting CS concepts with other fields of interest (Explore articles)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The keyboard functionality
                    </li>
                </ul>

                The way we synthesized our data was similar to Phase 1. However, in this phase, we sorted quotes from our interviews based on 
                the section of our prototype. This way, we were able to target exactly where we needed to adjust our prototype. We also peer 
                reviewed every transcript to ensure that we got a holistic interpretation of the quotes highlighted.

                        is bolded and in a separate color to make it stand out.

                        Per client’s request (and additional support from initial research) we added streaks to increase user motivation to 
                        consistently engage with the app and its contents.

            <h5>Phase 2.2 Research and Design</h5>
            <h6>Interviews</h6>
            <p>
                Our primary goal was to test several interventions throughout the application at the “10K-ft” level. These included: 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Addressing the main navigation to be more intuitive
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Improving on existing UI elements for directions and tutorials to include counters
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Making the visual language of the application more consistent
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding a trashcan into the main activity
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mirroring Minecraft with a more interactive tutorial for personal projects.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                We continued to learn how participants would utilize the application, including what their user pathway would be and any 
                common questions or pain points that might appear throughout the application. By focusing more on the functionality of the 
                application at the 10K-ft level, we can make actionable recommendations to the client and allow them to focus more on 
                10-ft details like content and color.
            </p>

            <br><br>
            <h6>Synthesis</h6>
            <p>
                We used the same process as our Phase 2.1 synthesis. Overall, our analysis illustrated a positive interaction between the 
                participants and the application, and most of the functionality seemed to flow. While we had our own limits within the 
                prototype that participants noted, they did not seem to find large changes that would need to be acted upon.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Findings</h6>
            <p>
                Most of our participants really like sports and video games, and we suggest adding more articles about how computer science 
                impacts sports and video games.

                <br><br>

                In the previous round of interview, there were suggestions about adding more languages to the read-out-loud function, but in 
                this round, none of the participants were fluent in other languages. Therefore, additional research into how bilingual 
                speakers would want to use the application should be done.

                <br><br>

                Similar suggestions were given about the instructions, as we may want to implement language options to users who prefer 
                instructions in different languages.

                <br><br>

                In the playground, while some participants wanted to be able to make changes to project examples, others didn't want to 
                because they worried that they would mess it up. To meet their needs, we can give them an option to copy the project examples 
                and make changes without changing the original work.

                <br><br>

                The other challenge that some participants faced was the reading part of the article. We could consider giving them an option 
                to adjust the size of the texts to enhance user experience and accessibility.

                <br><br>

                Additionally, participants were sometimes confused about how to delete a project. We added a trash can to address this issue.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>Future Iterations</h5>
            <h6>Streaks</h6>
            <p>
                We would like to further flesh out how streaks would work throughout the participant experience. While participants 
                self-reference Duolingo's streaks of 10 days, other numbers ranging from 5 to 20 days were mentioned. We also would recommend 
                identifying a balance to what part of the experience is used to count as a streak.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Sharing with Friends</h6>
            <p>
                In the playground section, participants noted how they would want to share the projects they make. Parents and kids do note the 
                anxiety and worry around online communications with potential strangers, and even sharing a project could be problematic. If 
                there were a sharing feature within the application, it would need to ensure the safety and privacy of the user, whilst also 
                making sure that the shared project is appropriate. Code.org could do a workaround of this by offering a submission process where 
                they evaluate projects and offer to showcase a certain number of projects a month for other end users to see and use as a template. 

                <br><br>

                Adding a notice, via a modal or button, about saving the project should also be incorporated into the design for extra transparency.                
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Automatic Vertical Scrolling</h6>
            <p>
                Because of the horizontal layout of the application, we didn't have a lot of vertical space to work with. We weren't able to fully 
                outline how longer instructions or blocks of code would fit within the screen. In both areas we would encourage using a vertical 
                scroll component, as this is consistent with navigation on the application. Allowing the sections to autoscroll when users run code 
                would also highlight the importance of debugging in block-based coding. When users run their code, they can see exactly where the 
                animation is within the code and make changes faster and easier. 
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Text-based Coding</h6>
            <p>
                After completing the main coding activities, users see a popup that shows their block-based code converted into text-based. 
                Participants generally indicated that they would want to learn text-based coding, and we would encourage Code.org to look at how they 
                might leverage this design to implement it. This could be achieved with the same look and feel, but instead of blocks, participants 
                could be presented with a word bank that they would drag and organize in the workspace appropriately.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Specialty Skins for Purchase</h6>
            <p>
                As participants have been vocal about enjoying the opportunity to customize their avatars and projects, Code.org could elevate 
                partnerships with other organizations by offering specialty skins for users to purchase with in-game rewards, similar to Fortnight. 
                Even for the main activity with Angry Birds, Code.org can incorporate other birds, pigs, and creatures from that franchise within 
                their lesson plan and in the avatar customization.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Dynamic Avatars</h6>
            <p>
                Due to the static assets we were provided with, we were not able to make the user's selected avatar more dynamic as we had originally 
                hoped. We encourage our client to incorporate avatars more throughout the application and user experience.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Additional Languages</h6>
            <p>
                Some of our participants were multilingual, and brought up the possibility of having multiple languages integrated into the UI. A 
                participant expressed that they would like the audio to be one language, and the written text in another. Code.org could look into how 
                end users could quickly change the audio and visual language of the application independently. Additionally, some more research should 
                be done to verify if custom controls at a more micro level would be appropriate.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Conduct Research with more Targeted Demographics</h6>
            <p>
                One of the objectives of this application is for it to be used in lower-income regions including Africa, Latin America, and India. 
                Unfortunately, due to the timeframe and resources given, we were not able to interview students from these regions, and instead would 
                encourage our client to conduct research within those populations and identify any specific needs that were not addressed within the 
                prototype.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            <p>
                Code.org on the Go is a user-friendly application that encourages young students to explore computer science through a mobile 
                version of the CSF Express curriculum on Code.org's website. Our prototype is a proof-of-concept that successfully migrated the 
                web curriculum into mobile whilst keeping the gameplay the same and adding features that would encourage new users to start.

                <br><br>

                Based on the findings from the six months of research, synthesis, and insights, we answered our initial guiding questions and 
                addressed each of our goals for the prototype.

                        <tr>
                            <th>Goal</th>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tr>
                        <td>
                            <b>Guiding Question #1:</b> How might we provide instruction in multiple forms through gamification to encourage different 
                            types of users to progress through the material?
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The main instruction is delivered through the main activities. To encourage users to complete activities consistently, 
                            we introduced streaks. Our qualitative research and literature review showed that streaks motivated users to continue 
                            using the app for longer periods of time. However, we would encourage there to be additional user testing to identify 
                            best practices for streaks.

                            <br><br>

                            We also implemented a reward-based system by providing users with stars any time they complete an activity. Stars can 
                            be used to customize their avatar in their profile to tailor the app to the individual. There was strong evidence from 
                            our competitive analysis (which was later supported by our own qualitative research) that showed that providing rewards 
                            encourages users to continue using the app.

                            <br><br>

                            In terms of instruction delivery, the Explore section of our prototype provides the content through multiple forms to 
                            ensure that users of all learning styles are able to grasp the material thoroughly. Articles are shown in video, audio, 
                            and kinesthetic format. Most forms of instruction within the app can be read outloud using the screen reader. Note that 
                            because this wasn't defined within our client's project scope, we did not flesh out this functionality.

                            <b>Guiding Question #2:</b> How might we ensure that the application provides personalized learning experiences to meet the 
                            unique needs of each user, and help them achieve their learning goals effectively?
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            To address the varying proficiency levels of each user, we incorporated a decision tree upon opening the app for the first 
                            time. The decision tree helped to tailor the curriculum to multiple CS backgrounds while still keeping the freedom of 
                            attempting every activity. When signing up, users have the option to take a skills test to test out of some of the easier 
                            activities in the curriculum. This helps to tailor the curriculum to the user's coding proficiency level. Additionally, 
                            users can test out of a topic by passing a short test on the topic. This ensures that users can accelerate their learning 
                            without missing out on important concepts.

                            <b>Guiding Question #3:</b> How might we encourage users to explore diverse topics and subject areas beyond their current 
                            interests and skill levels, and help them discover new areas of knowledge and expertise?
                        </td>
                        <td>
                            The Explore section was designed specifically to tackle this question. We took some of the interests that participants 
                            mentioned in our first phase of research and added them as articles within this section. The purpose of this was to connect 
                            participants' interests with CS concepts in the hope that more users could connect with the material easier.

                        <td>
                            The CSF Express curriculum is designed to be a free-roam experience for users of all experience levels. We kept this level of 
                            freedom by letting users have the choice to select any activity they'd like. While there are some guides on where users could 
                            go, they don't restrict the user from selecting any part of the app.

                            <br><br>

                            For the main coding activities, we kept the same drag-and-drop functionality in the mobile prototype. It was important to keep 
                            this seamless between the website and the mobile app so that it was easy for users to transition between the two.

                            The Playground section was designed in a way to encourage users to create whatever they'd like through the block-based coding 
                            functionality. We expanded upon the end-of-course project within the CSF Express curriculum by including project examples for 
                            inspiration. However, in our prototype, users can save their projects, and can make as many as they'd like without being 
                            restricted to one theme.

            <h5>Impact</h5>
            <p>
                Our prototype incorporated a space for children to have the freedom to create, and attempted to connect a vast variety of 
                common interests with computer science to pique their interest. With streaks and stars, children showed interest in using the 
                application consistently. In addition to these changes, we kept the essence of the CSF Express gameplay and ensured that the 
                UI was intuitive for both experienced and new users. We believe that this application will help our client connect with a wider 
                audience and get more students interested and involved in computer science.
            </p>

            <br>
            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
                This project spanned across six months, and there was a lot to accomplish within that time frame. All communication was done via 
                Slack, and I ensured that our team knew exactly what we were doing each week, what needed to be done, and why. We met through 
                Zoom twice a week to go over progress on different aspects of the project and to make sure that everyone was aware of what was 
                happening. I used waterfall timelines to detail when each phase of the project should be completed in order to present our research 
                to our clients on time. During team meetings, I reiterated things to complete by the end of that week and what to expect by our 
                next meeting. This information was also sent in our Slack channel at the end of each meeting.

                <br><br>

                I also managed regular and transparent communication between our team and our client, who we met online bi-weekly, to ensure that 
                our work was meeting our stakeholder's expectations. Any concerns or feedback we had throughout the project were brought up in a 
                timely manner and were addressed immediately. In terms of the softwares we used, I corresponded with our program administrators to 
                get proper licenses for the software we were using.

                <br><br>
                
                I made sure that all documentation was properly recorded in a shared Google Drive folder. I maintained a comprehensive, detailed, and 
                up-to-date documentation of our project plans. Everything was organized properly and was easily accessible on all forms of communication.

                <br><br>
                
                All project milestones were delivered on time consistently, thanks to our prioritization of project goals. This was a struggle for me at 
                first. Oftentimes, I would inaccurately estimate how long a part of the project was going to take, and this led to a fluctuating timeline. 
                However, as I learned more about the logistics of each phase of research and design, I was able to tighten the schedule and make our 
                timeline more efficient and reliable.

                Delegation was also something that I initially struggled with but gradually improved. I knew my team members' backgrounds and areas of 
                expertise, so I knew who could successfully do what. However, because this was a graduate program, I debated the idea of having the entire 
                team participate in each phase of the project so that everyone could get experience in each area. The biggest downside to this was that we 
                needed to set a longer timeframe for each phase of the project to account for learning curves. After some feedback from my team, I learned 
                that I needed to prioritize the project deadlines first, and to delegate roles based on everyone's prior experience and skills. This 
                significantly improved team efficiency, and we were able to deliver our project milestones easier.

                As I reflect on my experience as a Project Manager, I feel a sense of accomplishment and personal growth. I would say that my biggest 
                strengths as a PM were administrative work and time management, and my biggest weakness was delegation of project responsibilities. From the 
                way our work was divided, I contributed significantly to the design and research portion of the project on top of my responsibilities as a 
                PM. While that may not be how a traditional PM role looks like, I was glad that I could contribute to the core elements of our project and be 
                a reliable team player.

                This experience has imparted valuable lessons about project management, teamwork, and communication. Looking ahead, I aim to further enhance 
                my leadership skills and continue refining my delegation abilities to become an even more effective guide for future teams.
