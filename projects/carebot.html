            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                Carebot is a virtual chatbot that is designed to provide quality healthcare to people 24/7. It reduces the medical costs of annual checkups as well as travel 
                costs, as it is accessed through a smartwatch.

                <br><br>

                This project utilizes the Double-Diamond method, in which there are four main stages of a project's design process. The Discover stage is where we gather insights 
                into the project. The Define stage is where we refine our research and identify the project scope. The Develop stage is where we design possible solutions for the 
                problem scope. Finally, the Deliver stage is where we propose the finalized designs.

                How might we provide people without health insurance a convenient way to monitor their physical health issues and connect them to doctors and nurses through the use of 
                a chat system in a smartwatch?

                        <b>How does a smart watch track a user’s health?</b>
                        <br>
                        Smart watches have revolutionized how people track their health. Using sensors located underneath, a smart watch can record a user’s heart rate, physical 
                        activity, sleep patterns, and even stress levels (Beh). These features are being tracked constantly, and the smartwatch will notify the user if any abnormal 
                        measurements are recorded.
                    </p>

                        <b>How are people without health insurance disadvantaged when it comes to health care?</b>
                        <br>
                        The National Library of Medicine published an article in 2007 that depicts the irony of medical costs for the uninsured. Research shows that people without 
                        health insurance are more likely to have higher medical costs out-of-pocket (Davis). This prevents them from getting the care they need, resulting in a decrease 
                        in the overall health of these populations.

                        <b>How can chatbots be used for self-diagnosis?</b>
                        <br>
                        While it is helpful to search up symptoms online and receive a possible diagnosis, it is often inaccurate and not tailored to the individual. Chatbots are a great 
                        way to receive medical information accessible. With the advancements of AI, chatbots can provide medical advice to users and track their health without the need of 
                        a medical professional (Fan).

                        <b>How can healthcare be more accessible?</b>
                        <br>
                        There are many factors that would make healthcare inaccessible, one of which is long travel distances. Efforts are being made to reduce the transportation by 
                        providing healthcare virtually through mobile devices (Rodriguez-Villa). This eliminates the inconvenience of traveling and still provides people with reliable 
                        healthcare in the comfort of their homes.

            <h6>Product Sketches</h6>
            <p>
                The majority of the functions a smart watch can perform is through heart rate detection. Thus, the design needed to be able to read a user’s pulse to provide diagnosis.

                <br><br>

                Additionally, the product would need to have an led screen to display chat messages. It would need to be big enough for the user to interact with and be portable (smart 
                watch or mobile phone).

                    Pains: Still wary about new technology. Hard to select options on a small screen.
                    <br>
                    Gains: Can receive care and guidance at any time or place. Feels relieved for the convenience of care.

            <p>
                The main job to be done with Carebot is to make healthcare accessible to users. The related job to be done is to have users engage with a chat system. Users can list out 
                their symptoms and the chat can reply back with a diagnosis.

            <h6>Wizard-of-Oz</h6>
            <p>
                Here's my Wizard-of-Oz video that depicts the proof-of-concept for this project using a paper prototype. I then used this concept to create my Figma prototype. You can view 
                the Figma prototype at the top of this page, or through 
                <a href="https://www.figma.com/proto/Cjf8yURTfPlvvW7V6OvKVM/Project-1-UI-Design?type=design&node-id=13-2&t=Ik6k4c6pss1unky2-1&scaling=scale-down&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design"

                A Wizard-of-Oz (WOZ) is a mockup of a user interface that's controlled by a human. The goal of it is to narrow down the problem space and to test concepts more 
                directly with users in an inexpenxive way.
