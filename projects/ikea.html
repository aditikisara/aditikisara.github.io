            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                Ikea is a global leading brand for affordable home goods. In fact, there are 460 IKEA stores 
                in 62 markets globally. Their website plays a crucial role in catering it to its online 
                shoppers. As such, it is imperative that the website is user-friendly, efficient, and 
                effective in providing the optimal shopping experience. To ensure the website’s success, 
                our team of UX experts conducted several user evaluations over the course of three months 
                based on how well participants could find a specific chair.

                <br><br>

                Overall, our findings were focused on four specific areas.

            <h5>Expert Evaluation</h5>
            <h6>Approach</h6>
            <p>
                We conducted a heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielsen’s 10 Heuristics to identify potential 
                usability issues in IKEA's website. We focused on the Home, Product, Search Results, and 
                Sidebar pages.

            <h6>Summary of Findings</h6>
            <p>
                Through our heuristic evaluation, we identified the following:
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>To improve system visibility:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Adding a pull-down bar for the shopping menu to see items in cart without having to redirect to another page.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Saving the previously compared items while the user is still actively shopping.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>To reduce user errors:</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Highlighting error messages in red to make them stand out.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Suggesting products that the user might have mean after an error in search results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Adding a confirmation page after users add items to their cart.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Giving users more control over advanced filtering and search parameters.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
            <h6>Approach</h6>
            <p>
                Following the expert evaluation, we determined it would be valuable to audit the digital shopping experience of 
                IKEA’s direct and indirect competitors.

                <br><br>

                The competitor evaluation revealed areas IKEA is outperforming their competitors as well as opportunities to learn 
                from the best practices of these competitors. We believe that implementing the recommendations provided in this 
                report will improve the digital shopping experience for IKEA customers leading to increased revenue and higher 
                customer loyalty for IKEA.

                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            <b>User control and freedom</b>
                            <br><br>
                            The website does not make it easy to view items in shopping bag, forcing the user to navigate to a new page in order to see the items they have added.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">
                        <p>
                            <b>Clear context design</b>
                            <br><br>
                            IKEA’s product filter does not provide a clear indication of the active filters, leaving users confused as to which filters they have selected.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col">

                            <br><br>
                            The poor information architecture in the menu leads to longer search times.
                            <br><br>
                            Viewing the shopping cart takes too many unnecessary steps

            <h5>User Research</h5>
            <h6>Card Sorting #1</h6>
            <p>
                We conducted two separate card sorts to tackle different focus areas. 

                <br><br>
                
                The goal of the first card sort was to improve product recommendations based on users' searches, and to benchmark the current UI of the IKEA 
                website. We used Optimal Workshop to conduct a closed card sorting activity. This activity involved grouping product types (e.g. armchairs) 
                with other product types users consider similar into designated product categories. The product types and product categories were taken from 
                IKEA's website.

                <br><br>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/ikea/cs1.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
                <p class="caption">Card Sort #1 - Participant information</p>

                We used a standardization grid that showed how participants grouped items into different categories. Each row is an item that 
                participants sorted. The columns show the different groups they sorted them into. The numbers in each cell represent how many people grouped 
                that particular item in that specific category. In other words, products grouped consistently in the same category shows that users see 
                similarities between these products.

                <br><br>
                
                <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/ikea/cs1_grid.png" style="border: 3px solid #31025E; border-radius: 10px; width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
                <p class="caption">Card Sort #1 - Standardization Grid</p>

                This information was then cross-referenced with IKEA's current website. For instance, 11 out of 13 participants placed "Armchairs" into the 
                "Armchairs and Accent Chairs" category. On IKEA's website, armchairs can be found in the same category. While many items were sorted accurately 
                based on intuition, there were some discrepancies between our data and what we saw on IKEA's website. One example of this is how participants 
                sorted "Benches". Only 1 out of out 13 participants sorted this into the "Storage and Organization" category. However, when users searched for 
                benches on IKEA's website, one of the top categories for its search result was "Storage and Organization".

                <p class="caption">IKEA's Website - When searching for "benches", many search results are from the "Storage and Organization" category</p>
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Card Sorting #2</h6>
            <p>
                The goal of the second card sort was to improve the navigation in the menu to make searching easier, and to benchmark the current UI of the IKEA 
                website. We used Optimal Workshop to conduct a hybrid card sorting activity. This activity involved categorizing items from the hamburger menu 
                into predetermined groups. Participants also had the option to add their own categories as they see fit.

                <br><br>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/ikea/cs1.png" style="width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
                <p class="caption">Card Sort #2 - Participant information</p>

                For Card Sort #2, we looked at the hamburger menu on IKEA's website. We took each menu item and had participants sort them through categories we 
                came up with. Participants also had the option to create their own categories. We then had them rank these categories based on how important they 
                felt it was. The screenshot below shows the average position number participants ranked each category in.

                <br><br>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/ikea/cs2_ranks.png" style="border: 3px solid #31025E; border-radius: 10px; width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
                <p class="caption">Card Sort #2 - How participants ranked categories of the menu items</p>

                On average, users want to see options relating to Products or their Account on top. However, in IKEA's current menu bar, anything relating to 
                Accounts is at the very bottom in the smallest text.

                <br><br>

                <img class="img-fluid" src="../images/projects/ikea/cs2_menu.png" style="border: 3px solid #31025E; border-radius: 10px; width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
                <p class="caption">IKEA's Website - Hamburger Menu</p>

                Here's a standardization grid for this card sort. This grid gives us more information as to how each menu item is categorized.

            <br>
            <h6>Qualitative Usability Testing</h6>
            <p>
                We conducted 3 user testing sessions with previous IKEA customers from the US and UK who are familiar with the in-store IKEA experience. Using 
                UserTesting.com, we conducted live, unmoderated tests to collect verbal and rating-scale responses. We then analyzed these sessions and organized 
                this data to identify key themes and patterns.

                <br><br>

                <b>The goals of this test were to:</b>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand first impressions of the IKEA website</li>
                    <li>Uncover user expectations of product searches</li>
                    <li>Learn how users interact with their shopping bag</li>
                </ol>

                Overall, there were three main insights we found.

                <table id="ikea_insights">

                            “I couldn’t find chairs from the homepage, so I used the search bar to look for chairs instead.”

                            “Why are sofa and seat covers showing up when I searched for “living room chair”?”

                    </tr>
                    <tr>

                </table>
            </p>

            <br>
            <h6>Quantitative Usability Testing</h6>
            <p>
                For our qualitative test, we used Maze.co to administer surveys that participants can use to determine the usability of our prototype of IKEA's 
                website redesign. We conducted a total of 18 Maze surveys and 17 live interviews through Zoom, and calculated the System Usability Scale (SUS) 
                scores for the original IKEA website. 
                
                <br><br>
                
                SUS scores are determined through a ten-question quiz with responses ranging from "Strongly Agree" to "Strongly Disagree". Through these responses, 
                we're able to determine a rough measurement of the usability of the site out of 100. Anything below 50 is unacceptable, 50 to 70 is marginal, and 
                anything above 70 is acceptable. IKEA's website SUS score lands at 80.2, which means that their website is very usable. However, there's room for 
                improvement.

                Our redesign consisted of very small changes that effectively elevated the user experience based on our collective insights from our user research.

                For the cart sidebar, we included information about the user's item they added to their cart, and added a quick option to remove that item from 
                their cart. With this redesign:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>97.0%</b> of participants felt that the redesign gave them <b>more confidence</b> that an item had been added to their bag.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Green check mark iconography provided <b>immediate confirmation</b>.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Participants mentioned <b>liking the preview of their shopping bag</b> in pop out modal.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>76.5% of participants used the ‘remove product’ button</b> in the redesigned pop out modal rather than navigating to the full shopping 
                        bag view to delete an item.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                </table>

                <br>
                The filter status in the search page was also made clearer through color. Any filter that's applied to the search page is highlighted in yellow 
                to show that it's active. With this redesign:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>97.1%</b> of participants felt that the redesign gave them <b>more confidence</b> that the color filter is on.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some people did not immediately see the ‘black’ color chip, leading to user confusion and frustration. Participants mentioned the 
                        <b>yellow colored chip made it “easier to spot”</b> that the color filter was in use.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h5>Summary of Actionable Recommendations</h5>
            <p>
                To summarize our findings:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Search Page</b>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Provide status indicators in order to denote which filters are currently in use.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Make the appropriate filters automatically turn on when key words are typed into search bar.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Improvements to the search bar functionality such as error correction and relevant, more personalized recommendations 
                                could lead to more purchases.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                When a filter is in use, the product search results should only show items that fit the filter criteria (currently 
                                the ‘black’ filter will also show chairs that are not black).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Add confirmatory iconography to bolster user confidence that they are using the system correctly.

                            <li>
                                Giving the user more control over the functionality of the shopping bag, including a simpler way to see items currently 
                                in their bag, will result in an improved experience on the IKEA site.

            <h5>Next Steps</h5>

                There were many insights that we found through our user research that we weren't able to address in our redesign due to time constraints. 
                In the future, we would take the opportunity to run additional tests with more users to gain further data to create the best personalized 
                virtual experience for IKEA’s customers.
