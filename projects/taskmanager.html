            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                My team and I created a real-time, collaborative task manager that's modeled after a Kanban board. We used HTML and CSS to create the 
                basic layout of the document. We then used Flask in Python to create the functionality, and SQLite to maintain databases of each board 
                and the members joining in each board. To first create a board, the user writes down their username, the name of their board, and sets 
                a password for the board. This unique set of information is used by other users to join the same board. Within each board, users can 
                create tasks and mark them as "In-Progress" or "Completed". They also have the option to write notes on the bottom or clear all of the 
                tasks.

                <br><br>

                In future iterations, we would like to have users input the usernames of the people that are allowed in a board to make the app more 
                secure. Any time a user logs in, the information entered will be checked with our existing database. If the user is listed with the 
                board they specified in the database, then they will be allowed to enter the board. If not, then an error message would pop up.

                I would also like to change the layout of the board and adjust the color palette. Some things are hard to read due to the lack of 
                contrast, and the colors are not necessarily ADA compliant. Currently, users need to click on a task to move it to the next column. 
                However, I'd like to make this functionality a drag-and-drop instead to give users more control over where their tasks go.
            </p>

            <h5>Demo</h5>
            <p>
                Here's a video that shows this code in action! The code for this is also in my GitHub.

                <br><br>

                I use two separate accounts to log in. The first one shows what a new user would see when they first created a board. The second account 
                is an existing account in our database to show that the tasks created earlier would appear when the user logs back in.
