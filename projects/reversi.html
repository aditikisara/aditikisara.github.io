            <h5>Introduction</h5>
            <p>
                Reversi is a board game played by two players on an 8x8 board. Each player is assigned a different colored token and they take turns by 
                placing their token on the board. During a play, if any of the opponent's tokens are in a straight line and bounded by the current 
                player's tokens on either end, then the tokens in that line switch to the current player's token color. Whoever has the most tokens on 
                the board when the last playable square is filled wins.

                <br><br>

                There are three main aspects of the website: The home page, the lobby, and the game itself. The home page is where users enter their 
                username and join a lobby. The lobby page is where users can chat with other members of the lobby in real time. They can invite people 
                from the lobby to start a game, and when they do, they're directed to the game page. This is where the main game occurs, and both players 
                take turns placing tokens on the board. This board updates in real-time for both users.

                <br><br>
                
                You can play my version of Reversi too! Use two separate tabs to play as different people, or share it with someone and play against them!

            <h5>Overview of Files and Technologies Used</h5>
            <p>
                The following diagram shows the breakdown of the technologies used and the file system I had when coding this game. Overall, I used the 
                standard HTML and CSS to provide the layout and general styling of the elements on the page. JavaScript was used to program the interactivity 
                between these elements. I used Heroku to upload and run my application in the cloud.                
            </p>

            <h5>Reflection</h5>
            <p>
                Overall, this is a good online version of the game, but there are many improvements that could be made to streamline the user experience. There 
                are many instances where the color contrast of two elements can be increased for enhanced readability. I also had some trouble with the code when 
                it came to the game board. I wanted to write down the opponent's name on each player's screen, but I couldn't figure out an easy way to do that. 
                There's a few “loose ends” that I didn't tie, as seen through my analysis. Things like the issues with the timer or visual user feedback are 
                things that I want to fix in the future.
