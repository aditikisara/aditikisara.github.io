                        I am a 3rd year, undergraduate student at the University of California, Merced. I major in Computer Science and 
                        Engineereing and in the Fall 2022, I hope to start my Masters in Human-Computer Interaction and/or UX/UI 
                        development.

                        <br><br>

                        In my free time, I love to paint. In a world as complicated as this one, painting helps relive stress and allows 
                        me to forget about my worries for a little while.

                        <br><br>

                        While I do want to work as a UX/UI developer, I also want to use that knowledge to help people in underserved 
                        communities. I want people to be able to get access to a laptop or a phone whenever they need without worrying 
                        about whether they can buy food for the month. I want to use my skills to make it easier for people to find help 
                        online and make the world a little less complicated for them.
